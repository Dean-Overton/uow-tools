# CSIT312 Dockers

Sick of using VMs for your assessments and labs? This repository contains a collection of Dockerfiles for various tools and services that are commonly used in CSIT312.

## Why use Docker over VM?

- **Lightweight**: Docker containers are significantly smaller than VMs, which means they are faster to download, start, and stop.
- **Consistent**: Docker containers are built from a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains all the commands needed to build the container. This means that the container will always be built the same way, regardless of the host system.
- **Isolated**: Docker containers are isolated from the host system, which means that they cannot access the host system's files or network unless explicitly allowed.
- **Portable**: Docker containers can be easily moved between different systems, as long as the target system has Docker installed.
